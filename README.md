This was an assignment for my CSC 161 - Data Structures & Algorithms class.
The assignment was to complete the functionality of a Binary Search Tree.

My professor created the main.cpp, Node.h, and Node.cpp files along with the function prototypes.
I was tasked with building a BST given those specific sets of data abstraction.
